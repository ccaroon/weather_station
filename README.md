# weather_station
Weather Station library for the SparkFun Photo Weather Shield.

This code is still very much a work in progress. There's lots of cleaning up
and refactoring that can be done.

Also includes a `main.ino` that makes use of the library and sends data to Blynk.

Code pieced together from various other sources including tutorial and sample
code found on the SparkFun website.

Source citations coming soon...
